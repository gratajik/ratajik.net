Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. However, if you block or erase cookies, we may not be able to restore any preferences or customization settings you previously specified and our ability to personalize your online experience would be limited.

Instructions on how to update personal information will be given at the point of data collection.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  Unless you instruct us otherwise, Ratajik Software may contact you to provide information about products, services, promotions, contests, or other activities or offerings that may be of interest to you. You can instruct us whether or not you wish to be contacted by checking or removing the check from the box indicating your preference as applicable at the place where your information is collected, or by other means (such as an email request). In addition, with each communication you receive from Ratajik Software, you will be given the opportunity to indicate if you do not wish to receive future communications.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  Unless it is for the purposes you have requested or originally agreed, Ratajik Software will not share the personal information you provide on the Ratajik Software Web sites with any other parties, except (a) with your consent; (b) as may be required by law or court order; (c) to persons or companies with whom Ratajik Software contracts to carry out the internal operations of the site or our business; or (d) under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety or property of our users, the public or ourselves.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  Additionally and with your consent, Ratajik Software may share your personal information with other affiliated Ratajik.com companies (i.e., (i) Ratajik.com Corporation, (ii) any company of which more than 50% of its outstanding shares are owned by Ratajik.com, directly or indirectly, or (iii) any company with the name "Ratajik" as a part of its trade name) who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you. Further, only with your consent, Ratajik Software may share your personal information with specific third parties outside of the Ratajik.com group of companies who may want to contact you about products, services or other offerings that may be of interest to you. Please consult the respective privacy policies of each of these companies for further clarification as to their own privacy policy. Ratajik Software will seek to obtain your consent at the place where the information is collected either by an "opt-out" or "opt-in" method, or by other means (such as an email request). If you consent to receiving communications from any of these affiliated Ratajik.com companies, or third parties, you will need to communicate with them directly if you later decide that you no longer wish to receive their communications.

                  <br>
                  Notice To/Regarding Children Under the Age of 13<br>
                  Ratajik Software believes that children using the Internet require special protection, and we urge parents or guardians to explain Internet safety to their children. Parents are urged to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the Ratajik Software sites and the Internet in general. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers to help create a safer environment for children.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  If a child under 13 years of age wishes to participate in any Ratajik Software Web site activity, or wishes to take advantage of a product or service offering, available to children, and to do so necessitates the furnishing of any of the child's personal information, please note the following:&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  (i) Before any collection of a child's personal information takes place at a web site directed to children or where Ratajik Software is knowingly collecting children's personal information, the child will be asked to provide his/her parent's or guardian's e-mail address. Ratajik Software will then send an e-mail (the "Initial Notification") to the parent/guardian indicating, among other things, the information that the child is requested to provide, the intended use(s) of the information and information on how the parent/guardian can, at their election, delete the child's information from Ratajik Software's database or records. Upon receipt of the Initial Notification, a parent or guardian may respond back to Ratajik Software to grant his/her consent or to deny consent, in which case Ratajik Software will delete the parent or guardian's e-mail address. Upon Ratajik Software's receipt of the parent/guardian consent, Ratajik Software will send a confirming e-mail to the parent/guardian's e-mail address,&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  (ii)The e-mail address of the operator collecting or maintaining personal information from children through this Web site are: parents@ratajik.com,&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  (iii) The types of personal information collected from children may include the name, e-mail address, home address, telephone number and/or any other information reasonably necessary for the child to participate in a particular activity. This information may be collected directly and/or passively (e.g., through a web server that automatically recognized and stores information such as a visitor's IP address/domain name combination),&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  (iv) The information collected may be used for purposes such as fulfillment of a requested transaction, record keeping, marketing back to the child, or making it publicly available through a chat room or by other means,&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  (v) Unless specific consent is obtained from the child's parent or guardian, the child's personal information will not be disclosed to third parties who are not contractors hired to carry out the internal operations of the Web sites, other than as may be required or permitted by law. We have required, or will require, such contractors to agree to use personal information of site visitors only for the purposes of carrying out these operations and to keep such information confidential. A parent or guardian has the option of consenting to the collection and use of the child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties,&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  (vi) Ratajik Software is prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity,&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  (vii) A parent can review and have deleted the child's personal information, can refuse to permit further collection or use of the child's information, and can revoke or limit consents previously given. For instructions on how to do so, please send an e-mail to: PIM@ratajik.com and&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  (viii) If Ratajik Software desires to use a child's information for purposes other than that for which the parent/guardian consent was previously given, Ratajik Software will not do so without first getting the parent/guardian consent.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  Use and Disclosure of Anonymous Aggregated Information<br>
                  Ratajik Software may also collect, aggregate and maintain anonymous information about the visitors to our Web sites, such as visitors' hobbies, interests, purchasing habits, music preferences, and the like. This data can then be used to tailor Ratajik Software's Web site content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our visitors. In addition, Ratajik Software may also share such aggregate information about our visitors with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties; for example, to inform them about the percentage of male/female visitors or percentage of visitors within a particular age range.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  Consent to Processing:<br>
                  By providing any personal information to the Ratajik Software Sites, all users, including without limitation users in the member states of the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States of America.<br>
                  <br>
